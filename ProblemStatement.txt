Let's say there is a log file containing logs of an application.

the log messages are of the format

<level> <transaction_id> <timestamp> <event_type> <message>
eg:
-------------
INFO 1234 1707887000 BEGIN the order transaction 1 has started.
INFO 1234 1707887010 COMMIT the order transaction 1 has been committed.
....
INFO 1235 1707887000 BEGIN the order transaction 2 has started.
INFO 1235 1707887020 ROLLBACK the order transaction 2 has been rolled back.
....
-------------

level can be one of INFO, ERROR, DEBUG, WARN
transaction_id unique alpha numberic string

timestamp is epoch time in seconds
event_type can be one of BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK

The task is to find the top ten transactions that took the most time in seconds.
